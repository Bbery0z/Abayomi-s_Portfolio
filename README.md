## Let's Connect

I’m excited to continue learning and growing as a data analyst. Feel free to check out my most recent projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration.

### -Biodata Cleaning
This was a practice project I worked on during my internship at **Tech Studio Academy**.

#### Project Details:
- **Data Source**:
  Biodata from an establishment in Nigeria. The dataset came in a single column in excel file format.[Source File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwlJueP_Vg66NGirgtjO3bkHkUAWyYWD/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=100998320109364332065&rtpof=true&sd=true/)

#### Steps Taken(Using Python):  
1. The dataset was read into a pandas DataFrame using "pd.read_excel()"
2. Column split using delimiters with "str.split()"
3. Standardized Fullnames with "str.title()" and Reset Index with “data.reset_index(drop=True)”

### -USDA Commodity Price Analysis
This was also practice project I worked on during my internship at **Tech Studio Academy**.

#### Project Details:
- **Data Source**:  
  USDA pricing data from the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2022 and 2023. [Source File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uhUG5Z1v-GT9kbt7vX-mH3DEYtaK9fBe/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=100998320109364332065&rtpof=true&sd=true/)

#### Steps Taken(Using Excel and PowerBI tools):
1. **Data Concatenation**:  
   Combined data from 2022 and 2023 into a single dataset for analysis.
   
2. **Standardized Missing Values**:  
   Replaced inconsistent indicators for missing data with a standardized placeholder.
   
3. **Data Typing**:  
   Ensured numerical columns (e.g., High Price, Low Price, Average Price) were correctly typed for computations.
   
4. **Duplicate Removal**:  
   Removed duplicate rows to maintain dataset uniqueness.
